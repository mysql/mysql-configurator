## MySQL Server Instance Configuration File Template
## ----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Version 1.0.0
##
## <-- Indicates Template comment.  These lines will not be in the output
##
## Replaceable things must be like:
## 
## # [VARIABLE_NAME]="Formula"
## parameter=default value
##
##  For example:
##
##  # [PORT]="port"
##  port=3306
##
## Note - In the example, the formula consists of a variable named 'port' which must be defined before processing.
##
## In addition to the standard max operators (+, -, /, *), the "formula" field supports the following functions:
##
##  rnd(x, y) = Round x to the nearest y
##  max(x, y) = Max value from x, y
##  min(x, y) = Min value from x, y
##
## and named variables.
##
##  For example:
##
##  # [MAX_CONNECTIONS]="max_connections:rnd(max(100,max_connections),1000)"
##  max_connections=
##
## ( Note - Uninitialized variables have a value of 0. )
##
## Special directives:
## - [DEFAULT]: Allows to specify a default value for a variable.
## This directive must come as the first directive. If the Server
## type is set to 4 (Manual) it will cause other directives to be ignored,
## If the Server type is other than 4, this directive will be ignored.
## - [STATE_CHANGE]: Allows for a function to be executed at that 
## point during template processing.  
##
##  For example:
## # [STATE_CHANGE]="new_variable : 1"
##
## The following variables must be defined before the formulas are evaluated (otherwise, you get many values set to 0):
##
## memory             - Server Type
##                      Dedicated Server (90% of System Memory), Server (50% of System Memory), All others( rnd(max( 1/12 System Memory, 40*1024*1024), 1024))
## myiasm_percentage  - Table Type
##                      If main InnoDB, set to 5.  Allow userdef.
## active_connections - # Connections.
##                      DSS = 20, OLTP = 500, else user_defined.
## cpus               - Number of CPUS on the machine.
## 
# Other default tuning values
##
## innodb_buffer_pool_size_percentage=2/10
# [STATE_CHANGE]="over_commit_factor:10"

# MySQL Server Instance Configuration File
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generated by the MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard
#
#
# Installation Instructions
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On Linux you can copy this file to /etc/my.cnf to set global options,
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options
# (@localstatedir@ for this installation) or to
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.
#
# On Windows, when MySQL has been installed using MySQL Installer you
# should keep this file in the ProgramData directory of your server
# (e.g. C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y). To make sure the server
# reads the config file, use the startup option "--defaults-file". 
#
# To run the server from the command line, execute this in a 
# command line shell, e.g.
# mysqld --defaults-file="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini"
#
# To install the server as a Windows service manually, execute this in a 
# command line shell, e.g.
# mysqld --install MySQLXY --defaults-file="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini"
#
# And then execute this in a command line shell to start the server, e.g.
# net start MySQLXY
#
#
# Guidelines for editing this file
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that the program supports.
# If you want to know the options a program supports, start the program
# with the "--help" option.
#
# More detailed information about the individual options can also be
# found in the manual.
#
# For advice on how to change settings please see
# https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-configuration-defaults.html
#
#
# CLIENT SECTION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The following options will be read by MySQL client applications.
# Note that only client applications shipped by MySQL are guaranteed
# to read this section. If you want your own MySQL client program to
# honor these values, you need to specify it as an option during the
# MySQL client library initialization.
